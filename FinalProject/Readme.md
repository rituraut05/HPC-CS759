# Parallel Sudoku Solver

A parallel sudoku solver for large puzzles using CUDA and OpenMP.


## Deployment

To run the project on Euler use the below commands

```bash
module load nvidia/cuda/11.6.0 
nvcc cuda_solver.cu helper.cu -o cuda
sbatch run.sh
```



## Useful project files details

1. To validate the sudoku generated by your code in result.txt you can use
`is_valid.cpp`

2. `helper.cuh` contains the definition for rank, rank^2 and sqrt(rank) as N, N2, Nr respectively.

3. `serial_solver.cpp` contains the code for serial implementation of sudoku solver.

4. `cuda_solver.cu` has the CUDA implementation of sudoku solver. It also uses helper functions defined in `helper.cu`.

5. `omp_solver.cpp` has the initial OMP implementation of sudoku solver. 

6. `puzzles` folder has the input files for different sudoku ranks.
